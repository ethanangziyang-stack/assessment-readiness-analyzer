# Assessment Prioritizer

*Supporting academic excellence whildt building healthy, sustainable study habits*

## Problem Statement

Students in Singapore are expected to meet high academic standards across multiple subjects. While many students rely on informal planning or hard set timetables, these approaches often fail to account for individual academic weaknesses, confidence levels, and the presence of external academic support such as tuition. As a result, students may spend excessive time on subjects they are already strong in, neglect weaker areas, or engage in unhealthy late-night studying that negatively impacts long-term performance. Therefore, How can we help unmotivated, sleep deprived and confused students get back on track while being constantly motivated to keep interest levels high whilst still prioritising sleep in alighnment with Grow well SG and maintaining high expectations?

The Assessment Prioritizer was developed to address this problem by providing a structured, data-driven approach to study planning that balances academic rigour with student wellbeing.

## Design Idea

The application prioritises revision subjects using a combination of academic performance, self-reported confidence, and tuition support. Instead of relying on raw numerical scores, subjects are entered using familiar Singapore grading bands (A1–F9), ensuring accessibility and realism. Confidence is included as a behavioural indicator, recognising that students often struggle most with subjects they feel uncertain about, even if grades appear acceptable.

## Alignment with Grow Well SG

In alignment with Grow Well SG , the application treats sleep as a protected necessity rather than optional study time. Study sessions are generated only within a defined free-time window between “reach home” and “sleep” times. If students select excessively late sleep times, the app provides warnings and suggested healthy ranges, encouraging consistent routines that support cognitive performance, emotional wellbeing, and long-term academic success.

This approach reinforces the idea that sustainable habits, not burnout, lead to meaningful achievement.

## High Academic Expectations

While promoting wellbeing, the Assessment Prioritizer maintains high academic expectations by systematically identifying areas of weakness and allocating focused study time accordingly. The app encourages students to take ownership of their learning, make informed decisions, and engage in purposeful revision. By combining disciplined planning with healthy routines, the application supports students in striving for excellence without compromising their overall development.
